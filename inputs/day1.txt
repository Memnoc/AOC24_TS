--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---

You have two lists of numbers
The objective is reconcile them as they look quite different

The prompt suggests to pair up the smalles number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second smallest left number with the second smallest right number, and so on.


Sample list 
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3


1) Create two lists
2) Compare the lists by smallest number 
3) Measure the gap between numbers 
4) Add up the gaps
Ex. left-3 - right-7 = 4
Ex. left-9 - right-3 = 6
5) Find the total distance = all the distances from the two lists


Reflections
How do I deal with duplicate numbers?
